            In India, skill development has been regarded as one of the most important
            factors in job generation. India enjoys a special demographic advantage because
            more than 60% of the population is under 25 years old. However, employability
            needs to be raised in order to benefit from such a sizable workforce.
            <br /><br />
            According to recent data, just 10% of recent graduates are employable, and the
            other 90% do not possess the necessary abilities to qualify for employment by
            a firm. The GDP of India is increasing at a healthy rate of about 6â€“8%, but
            employment growth is not keeping up.  Support by Donate to NGO or Donate to Poor.
